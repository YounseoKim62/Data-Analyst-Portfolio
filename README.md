## Data Analysis Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Reddit Topic Prediction
**Code:** [`features_engineering.R`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/6dbe17138fbba4fc10c0d29b31cf59b73d0b635d/Reddit%20Topic%20Prediction/src/features/features_engineering.R), 
[`prediction_model.R`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/6dbe17138fbba4fc10c0d29b31cf59b73d0b635d/Reddit%20Topic%20Prediction/src/model/prediction%20model.R)

**Description:** The project encompasses the application of advanced machine learning techniques for text classification by predicting the origin of subreddit comments using the XGBoost algorithm. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, model training and prediction. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transformation, data integration, machine learning

**Technology:** R, XGBoost, Excel



### Performance of Arsenal and Tottenham Against Big 6 Clubs A Goals-Based Analysis
**Code:** [`Performance of Arsenal and Tottenham.Rmd`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/e847a085e80d1b60205c557ff7f3f9830407e7ad/Performance%20of%20Arsenal%20and%20Tottenham%20Against%20Big%206%20Clubs%20A%20Goals-Based%20Analysis)

**Report:** [`Performance of Arsenal and Tottenham.pdf`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/58da1a13c9838c69afa22f9e31976a634c12ce6b/Performance%20of%20Arsenal%20and%20Tottenham%20Against%20Big%206%20Clubs%20A%20Goals-Based%20Analysis/Performance%20of%20Arsenal%20and%20Tottenham.pdf)

**Description:** The study analyzes Arsenal and Tottenham's performance against top Premier League clubs, focusing on the effect of home and away games and seasonal variations on goal scoring by ANOVA. The study involves collecting data, cleaning data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis (ANOVA), and Post Hoc analysis. 

**Skills:** data collection, data cleaning, data transformation, data integration, data visualization, data analysis, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, descriptive statistics

**Technology:** R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, Excel

**Results:** The result of ANOVA analysis indicates a significant interaction between team and location, but not in specific combinations, indicating a potential Type 1 Error.



### Car Value Analytics
**Code:** [`Car Value Analytics.Rmd`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Car%20Value%20Analytics/Car%20Value%20Analytics.Rmd)

**Report:**: [`Car Value Analytics.pdf`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/58da1a13c9838c69afa22f9e31976a634c12ce6b/Car%20Value%20Analytics/Car%20Value%20Analytics.pdf)

**Description:** The project analyzes a dataset of used car sales, focusing on how factors like age, mileage, model, and zip code affect their prices by two-way ANOVA. The project involves data wrangling, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis (ANOVA).

**Skills:** data cleaning, data transformation, data integration, data visualization, data analysis, ANOVA, descriptive statistics

**Technology:** R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, Excel

**Results:** The result of ANOVA analysis demonstrates that age, mileage, car model, and zip code are all statistically significant factors affecting the price of used cars.
