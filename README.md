In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Car Value Analytics
**Code:** [`Car Value Analytics.Rmd`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Car%20Value%20Analytics/Car%20Value%20Analytics.Rmd)

**Goal:** To statistically validate whether certain factors indeed play a significant role in determining the market value of used cars

**Description:** This project analyzes a dataset of used car sales, focusing on how factors like age, mileage, model, and zip code affect their prices. The project involved loading and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis (ANOVA).

**Skills:** data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis, ANOVA 

**Technology:** R, ggplot2, tidyverse

**Results:** The result of ANOVA analysis demonstrated that age, mileage, car model, and zip code are all statistically significant factors affecting the price of used cars.
