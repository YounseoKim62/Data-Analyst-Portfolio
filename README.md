### Performance of Arsenal and Tottenham Against Big 6 Clubs A Goals-Based Analysis
**Code:** [`Performance of Arsenal and Tottenham.Rmd`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/e847a085e80d1b60205c557ff7f3f9830407e7ad/Performance%20of%20Arsenal%20and%20Tottenham%20Against%20Big%206%20Clubs%20A%20Goals-Based%20Analysis)

**Report:** [`Performance of Arsenal and Tottenham.pdf`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/58da1a13c9838c69afa22f9e31976a634c12ce6b/Performance%20of%20Arsenal%20and%20Tottenham%20Against%20Big%206%20Clubs%20A%20Goals-Based%20Analysis/Performance%20of%20Arsenal%20and%20Tottenham.pdf)

**Description:** The study analyzes Arsenal and Tottenham's performance against top Premier League clubs, focusing on the effect of home and away games and seasonal variations on goal scoring, using ANOVA. The report also outlines its limitations and suggests areas for future study.

**Skills:** data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, descriptive statistics

**Technology:** R, Excel

**Results:** The result of ANOVA analysis indicated a significant interaction between team and location, but not in specific combinations, indicating a potential Type 1 Error.



### Car Value Analytics
**Code:** [`Car Value Analytics.Rmd`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/main/Car%20Value%20Analytics/Car%20Value%20Analytics.Rmd)

**Report:**: [`Car Value Analytics.pdf`](https://github.com/YounseoKim62/Data-Analysis-Projects/blob/58da1a13c9838c69afa22f9e31976a634c12ce6b/Car%20Value%20Analytics/Car%20Value%20Analytics.pdf)

**Description:** The project analyzes a dataset of used car sales, focusing on how factors like age, mileage, model, and zip code affect their prices. The project involved loading and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis (ANOVA).

**Skills:** data cleaning, data visualization, data analysis, ANOVA, descriptive statistics

**Technology:** R, Excel

**Results:** The result of ANOVA analysis demonstrated that age, mileage, car model, and zip code are all statistically significant factors affecting the price of used cars.
